# Organization Dropdown Fix

## Problem Identified
The organization dropdown was not loading when selecting "Doctor" or "Pharmacist" role because:

1. **API was working correctly** - returning 200 status codes
2. **Database contained organizations** - "Regov Technologies" exists
3. **Root cause**: The organization in the database had `verified: false`, but the frontend was requesting only `verified=true` organizations

## API Response Analysis
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "organizations": [
      {
        "id": "689174dd2f0a5ae7c7ada8e",
        "name": "Regov Technologies", 
        "type": "HOSPITAL",
        "city": "Petaling Jaya",
        "state": "Selangor",
        "verified": false,  // ← This was the issue
        "registrationNumber": "Regov Technologies"
      }
    ],
    "count": 1
  }
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Development Mode Fix
Updated the RegisterForm to include unverified organizations during development:

```typescript
// In RegisterForm.tsx - fetchOrganizations function
const verifiedParam = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'false' : 'true';
const response = await fetch(`/api/organizations/list?verified=${verifiedParam}&limit=50`);
```

**Result**: In development, both verified and unverified organizations will appear in the dropdown.

### 2. Organization Verification Endpoint
Created `/api/debug/verify-organization` endpoint to manually verify organizations during development:

```typescript
// POST /api/debug/verify-organization
{
  "organizationId": "689174dd2f0a5ae7c7ada8e"
}
```

**Result**: Allows manual verification of organizations for testing purposes.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test the dropdown fix**:
   - Navigate to `/register`
   - Select "Doctor" or "Pharmacist" role
   - Organization dropdown should now show "Regov Technologies"

2. **Verify an organization** (optional):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/debug/verify-organization" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"organizationId": "689174dd2f0a5ae7c7ada8e"}'
   ```

3. **Test with verified organizations only**:
   - After verification, the organization will appear even with `verified=true` filter

## Files Modified

1. **components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx**
   - Updated `fetchOrganizations()` to include unverified organizations in development
   - Maintains production security by only showing verified organizations in production

2. **app/api/debug/verify-organization/route.ts** (new)
   - Development-only endpoint to manually verify organizations
   - Updates `verification.isVerified` to `true`

## Security Considerations

- **Development only**: The fix to show unverified organizations only applies in `NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- **Production safe**: Production environments will continue to show only verified organizations
- **Debug endpoints**: All debug endpoints check for development environment and return 403 in production

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Organization dropdown now loads correctly when selecting healthcare professional roles.
