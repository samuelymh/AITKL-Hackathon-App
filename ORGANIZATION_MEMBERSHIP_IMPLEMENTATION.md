# Organization Membership Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the organization membership feature during user registration. When users select "doctor" or "pharmacist" role, they can now choose from a dropdown of verified organizations and provide professional information. This creates the necessary records to link healthcare professionals to their organizations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Registration API (`/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added imports for Practitioner, OrganizationMember, and Organization models
- Extended RegisterSchema to include:
  - `organizationId`: Optional field with ObjectId validation
  - `professionalInfo`: Object containing license number, specialty, years of experience, position, and department
- Added validation to require organizationId and professional info for doctors/pharmacists
- Enhanced registration handler to:
  - Validate organization exists and is verified
  - Create Practitioner record for healthcare professionals
  - Create OrganizationMember record linking practitioner to organization
  - Set appropriate permissions and status (pending verification)

**Key Features:**
- Organization verification check - users can only join verified organizations
- Automatic Practitioner record creation with professional information
- OrganizationMember record with pending status for admin approval
- Primary organization flag set to true for first organization
- Proper error handling for organization not found or unverified

### 2. Enhanced Registration Form (`/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Extended form schema to include professional information fields
- Added professional info section that appears for doctors/pharmacists
- Included fields for:
  - License Number (required)
  - Specialty (required)
  - Years of Experience (required)
  - Current Position (optional)
  - Department (optional)
- Enhanced validation to require all professional fields for healthcare roles
- Added form reset logic to clear professional info when role changes to patient

**UI Improvements:**
- Professional information appears in a styled section with gray background
- Proper field validation and error display
- Responsive grid layout for professional fields
- Special handling for years of experience as number input

### 3. Data Flow

**Registration Process for Healthcare Professionals:**
1. User selects "doctor" or "pharmacist" role
2. Organization dropdown loads verified organizations
3. Professional information fields appear
4. User fills out all required fields
5. On submit:
   - User record created with auth details
   - Practitioner record created with professional info
   - OrganizationMember record created linking practitioner to organization
   - Organization membership status set to "pending" for admin approval

### 4. Database Records Created

**For Doctor/Pharmacist Registration:**
1. **User**: Standard user record with role and auth details
2. **Practitioner**: Professional information and license details
3. **OrganizationMember**: Links practitioner to organization with:
   - Role-based permissions (preset based on practitioner type)
   - Pending status requiring admin approval
   - Primary organization flag set to true
   - Metadata tracking creation source

### 5. Security & Validation

**Validation Rules:**
- Organization must exist and be verified
- License number, specialty, and years of experience required for healthcare roles
- Proper ObjectId validation for organization selection
- Email uniqueness preserved from existing system

**Security Features:**
- Rate limiting on registration endpoint (3 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Password hashing with existing auth system
- Audit trails on all created records
- Pending status for organization membership requiring admin approval

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Navigate to `/register`
2. Select "Doctor" or "Pharmacist" role
3. Choose an organization from the dropdown
4. Fill out professional information
5. Complete registration
6. Verify records are created in database

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Email verification workflow for new members
2. Organization admin approval workflow
3. Bulk import of organization members
4. Integration with professional licensing verification services
5. Advanced permission management UI

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Registration API with organization membership logic
2. `/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx` - Enhanced form with professional information
3. `/app/api/organizations/list/route.ts` - Organization dropdown API (previously created)

## Dependencies

- Existing User, Practitioner, OrganizationMember, and Organization models
- Authentication system with JWT tokens
- Zod validation library
- UI components (Input, Select, etc.)

The implementation is now complete and ready for testing. Healthcare professionals can register and be automatically linked to their chosen organizations with appropriate pending status for admin approval.
