## üöÄ Quick Start Test Sequence

For a rapid functionality test, try these questions in order:

1. **"Tell me about this patient"** (Basic overview)
2. **"What are the key safety concerns?"** (Safety assessment)
3. **"Are there any drug interactions to worry about?"** (Medication safety)
4. **"What diagnostic tests should I consider?"** (Clinical reasoning)
5. **"How should I adjust their treatment plan?"** (Treatment optimization)

This sequence tests the core functionality and will give you a good sense of the AI's capabilities and response quality.
