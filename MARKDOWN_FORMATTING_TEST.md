# Markdown Formatting Test for Clinical AI Assistant

## 🎯 Testing the New Markdown Renderer

The Clinical AI Assistant now uses **React Markdown** with the following improvements:

### ✨ Enhanced Formatting Features

1. **Proper Headings** - Using `#`, `##`, `###` syntax
2. **Bold and Italics** - Using `**bold**` and `*italics*`
3. **Lists** - Both numbered and bulleted lists
4. **Code Blocks** - Inline `code` and code blocks
5. **Blockquotes** - For important notes
6. **Tables** - If needed for structured data

### 📝 Example AI Response Format

Here's how clinical responses will now be formatted:

#### **Clinical Patterns:**
The patient has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, which is an active condition. They are currently using:

- **Salbutamol 100mcg** (2 puffs as needed)
- Started on 8/9/2025

> **Important Note:** The recent frequent emergency visits for severe lower back pain suggest that further evaluation of the patient's musculoskeletal health may be needed.

#### **Safety Concerns:**
1. **Multiple Allergies** - Patient has known allergies including:
   - Ibuprofen
   - Fish, sesame, soy
   - Dust mites and eggs

2. **Medication Interactions** - Essential to consider these allergies when prescribing new medications

#### **Treatment Recommendations:**
- **COPD Management:** Consider adjusting bronchodilator therapy
- **Pain Management:** Explore alternatives to NSAIDs due to ibuprofen allergy
- **Monitoring:** Regular spirometry and symptom tracking

### 🚀 Benefits of Markdown Formatting

✅ **Better Readability** - Proper text hierarchy and spacing
✅ **Professional Appearance** - Consistent formatting across all responses  
✅ **Enhanced Structure** - Clear sections with proper headings
✅ **Improved UX** - Easier to scan and understand clinical information
✅ **Semantic Markup** - Proper HTML structure for accessibility

## Test Questions to Try

Use these markdown-rich questions to test the formatting:

```
Tell me about this patient's **current medications** and any potential *drug interactions*

What are the key **safety alerts** I should be aware of?

Provide a comprehensive analysis with:
1. Patient summary
2. Risk factors  
3. Clinical recommendations
```

The responses will now be beautifully formatted with proper headings, lists, emphasis, and structure!
