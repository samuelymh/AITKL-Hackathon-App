- **Key Functions**:
  - `generateClinicalInsights()`: Main entry point for clinical analysis
  - `generateClinicalBriefing()`: Patient summary with key findings
  - `analyzeSafetyConcerns()`: Drug interactions, allergies, contraindications
  - `generateClinicalRecommendations()`: Evidence-based assessment suggestions
  - `identifyCareGaps()`: Missing preventive care and optimization opportunities
  - `analyzeTrends()`: Health pattern analysis from encounter history

### 2. Enhanced Groq Healthcare Service (`/lib/services/groq-healthcare.ts`)
- **New Session Type**: `clinical_analysis` for doctor-focused interactions
- **Clinical Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for clinical decision support
- **Patient Context Integration**: Automatic patient data aggregation for doctors
- **Response Enhancement**: Clinical insights attached to AI responses

### 3. Doctor Clinical Assistant UI (`/components/ai/DoctorClinicalAssistant.tsx`)
- **Floating Chat Interface**: Brain icon for easy access
- **Structured Insights Display**: 
  - Clinical Briefing with patient summary
  - Safety Alerts (critical/warning/info)
  - Clinical Recommendations by category and priority
  - Trend Analysis with visual indicators
  - Care Optimization opportunities
- **Patient Context Aware**: Shows patient name and uses patient ID for analysis
- **Expandable Sections**: Collapsible insight categories for better UX

## üè• Clinical Intelligence Categories

### Safety Alerts
- **Critical**: Drug allergies, contraindications, emergency conditions
- **Warning**: Elevated vitals, medication interactions, clinical concerns
- **Info**: General safety reminders and monitoring recommendations

### Clinical Recommendations
- **Assessment**: Diagnostic workup suggestions
- **Diagnostic**: Test ordering and interpretation guidance
- **Treatment**: Therapeutic interventions and adjustments
- **Monitoring**: Follow-up and surveillance recommendations  
- **Referral**: Specialist consultation suggestions

### Care Optimization
- **Gaps**: Missing preventive care, overdue screenings
- **Opportunities**: Care coordination improvements
- **Efficiency**: Workflow and documentation enhancements

### Trend Analysis
- **Improving**: Positive health trends and treatment response
- **Stable**: Maintained clinical status
- **Declining**: Concerning changes requiring attention
- **Concerning**: Critical changes needing immediate action

## üöÄ Integration Points

### Doctor Dashboard Integration
- **Patient Record Page** (`/app/doctor/patient/[digitalId]/page.tsx`)
- **Medical History Page** (`/app/doctor/medical-history/[digitalId]/page.tsx`)
- Floating assistant appears on patient-specific pages
- Patient context automatically loaded based on current patient

### API Integration
- Uses existing `/api/ai/chat` endpoint
- Session type: `clinical_analysis`
- Context includes `patientId` for doctor users
- Returns enhanced response with `clinicalInsights` object

## üìä Data Flow

```
1. Doctor opens patient record ‚Üí Component loads with patientId
2. Doctor asks clinical question ‚Üí Message sent with context
3. Backend gathers patient medical context ‚Üí Full history aggregated
4. Clinical Analysis Service processes ‚Üí Structured insights generated
5. LLM generates response with clinical prompt ‚Üí AI provides clinical guidance
6. UI displays both response and insights ‚Üí Doctor sees actionable intelligence
```

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Role-Based Access**: Only doctors can access clinical analysis
- **Patient Authorization**: Requires active patient consent/grant
- **Data Encryption**: Patient context retrieved securely
- **Audit Logging**: All clinical AI interactions logged
- **Token Authentication**: Secure API access with JWT

## üß™ Testing

Comprehensive test suite (`/__tests__/services/clinical-analysis-service.test.ts`):
- Clinical insight generation
- Safety alert detection
- Recommendation categorization
- Trend analysis accuracy
- Edge case handling
- Empty context graceful handling

## üéØ Clinical Use Cases
